          Previously, I spent 6 years consulting for different companies, building a resume of
          clients that includes Fortune 500 companies, non-profits, and small startups. My
          experience consulting taught me how to communicate with empathy, and how to work with
          people to build the best solution to fit their needs.

          My experience as a consultant helped me grow communication skills that are useful outside
          of the consulting world. Being able to listen with empathy and communicate ideas in a
          consistent manner are essential parts of software engineering.
