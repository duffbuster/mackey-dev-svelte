    body: `When Colin developed the PsychExchange Podcast website, he was amazing. He took all of our
    notes and wishes in terms of design and functionality and incorporated all of them into the
    final product. He also then taught our team how to make future updates to the website as
    needed! Colin was fast, responsive, a good listener, and most importantly extremely
    effective. We are so happy with the final product! For your next project, I wouldnâ€™t look
    anywhere else.`,
